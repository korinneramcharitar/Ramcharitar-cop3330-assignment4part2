They are able to essentially cancel whatever they are doing by using the home button. Once this button is clicked, nothing will be saved!
They may save the list using the savelist button however the file path is set to my own. If they wish to change it they will have to go  into the TodoTemplateController Class under SaveListButtonClicked and set the path to their own directory.
The same goes for uploading a list. The directory must be changed under the buttonevent for uploadlistbuttonclicked to their own directory.
The show complete tasks and incomplete tasks buttons do not work. They will be released in the next update. The checkboxes are for personal use to let the user know they have completed tasks.
